v1:
G learning rate = 2e^4
D learning rate = 2e^4

Training Order: one D, one G


v1.1: 
goal: make it so that the generator loss is less -> increase the number generator training periods and put it before the discriminator training step
G learning rate = 2e^4
D learning rate = 2e^4

Training Order: two G, one D

Result: 
d loss was higher than g loss
d accuracy too low -> generator not improving


v1.2:
goal: make the generator loss a little bit less than for v1, also make the d loss a tad bit lower -> increase the learning rate of D to be 4 times G learning rate, train D before g
G learning rate = 2e^4
D learning rate = 8e^4

Training Order: one D, one G

Result:
