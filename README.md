A MATH-356 final project exploring GANs.

The ``Toy Example`` folder contains source code and model weights for a simple GAN trained on the MNIST dataset (the generator model learned to generate handwritten digits).

The ``Full Example`` folder contains source code and model weights for a more complicated convolutional GAN trained on the CelebA dataset (the generator model learned to generate human faces).
